Just one suggestion for you <strong>Jitni aish karni hai karle, aage life bahut bjane wali hai</strong>. I really feel jealous sometimes, seeing you relaxed and tension-free.</p>

			<strong>My   birth nickname given by mom and the one I love the most because of the same reason. This is my most common nickname. Everyone in the family calls me by this. I don't remember from where did this name came as I was too small too remember . But its a cute little name.

				<h1><label style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">Goel</label></h1>
			<strong>This is the name which most of my friends use to call me and I like this too. The reason for this nickname seems obvious as I am Aayush <label class="col">Goel</label>. Nice name to be called by I guess. This will be my nickname in the IIIT hoddie.

			<h1><label style="color: blue;">Sanouri</label></h1>
			<p><strong>
				I got this nick-name from my coaching friends. The reason for this is my home-town <label class="col">Sanour</label>. How's this for a nickname . People can get a nick-name from literally anything. Initially this irritated me a bit but now I like it. I miss you guys calling me <label class="col"> Sanouri</label>. Hopefully meet you soon and hope to listen that pretty soon.

			<h1><label style="color: blue;">Glucose</label></h1>
			<p><strong>Yes you read it correctly , its <label class="col">Glucose</label>. Literally, I don't know the reason nor do the one who call me by the name. Actually the origin of the nickname is a bit mysterious. The one who calls me by the name is the most special friend in my life. Initially the name irritated me as how can glucose be a human's name but now I am pretty use to it and also the no. of people using this name has increased from one.</strong></p>
